## divIndex: Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence Diversity Indices

`divIndex` is an R package implementing sequence diversity indices described in Gregori J. et al. (2016), Viral quasispecies complexity measures, *Virology*, 2016;493:227‚Äê237. It builds on top of the original R code written by the authors.

<!--It  contains functions that characterize malaria diversity within individuals. These functions were down-selected based on a combination of their statistical properties and recommendations by Gregori et al. (2016). They were used in a effort to provide a more detailed analysis of sieve effects in the efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01E malaria vaccine.-->

<!--The functions take as input an individual subject's genetic information, which takes the form of multiple reads of various haplotypes.-->
