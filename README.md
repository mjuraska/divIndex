# divIndex

divIndex contains functions that characterize malaria diversity within individuals. These functions were down-selected based on a combination of their statistical properties and recommendations by Gregori et al. (2016). They were used in a effort to provide a more detailed analysis of sieve effects in the efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01E malaria vaccine. 

The functions take as input an individual subject's genetic information, which takes the form of multiple reads of various haplotypes.
